# week-one-refactor-challenge Refactoring code in HTML to make the website as easily accessible and interactive for desktop users.(Web Accessibility on a website called Horiseon)

# Issues I have Tweaked and Code that I have Implemented

- I consolidated or compressed selectors like elements which allows you to reduce the combination of code and text that is on the page,furthermore making it more simpler to read.

- Made changes to elements which may have been out of place using the white lines and changed numbered section elements to put it in sequential order e.g. h1,h2,h4 to h1,h2,h3

- Added alt text to images and apperances within the website to describe and summon how they look like

- Added comments along with the elements to make it unique e.g. along with the title element added a comment 'Horiseon' which resonates with the info on the webpage when you direct to it.
